Final Project Start 23-04-20, Finish 08-05-20

Created in two weeks as a final project for Full-Stack Web Development Diploma with Concordia Bootcamps.

This project was borne off the quest of what happens to those escaped party balloons that disappear off into the horizon.
"Where is My Balloon?" leverages real-time wind data to allow users to launch a hot-air-balloon and travel the world according to natures whims.

Technologies utilized in this project include:
React, Redux, Javascript, Styled Components, Express.js, Firebase Real-Time DB.
Mapping was accomplished using Leaflet and Leaflet-React along with OpenStreetMaps.
Weather and Wind data is retrieved using the Darksky API.
Nearby images are gathered via Bing Image Search API.
Tracking of closest city to balloon is achieved via the Overpass API.

FEATURES
The Background was created from scratch using styled components. It changes dynamically to represent both the time-of-day and weather conditions local to your balloon.

Users can customise their balloon icon, which will be persistant to their profile and visible to other users.


FUTURE GOALS
There are many additional features I would like to add to this game to both increase gameplay, quality of life and performance.

While the list is expansive here are some shorter term goals:
- Increase sign-in options. Expand to Facebook etc logins as well as app only credentials.
- Increase security on inputs.
- Add option to disable dynamic background, also off by default for animation reducing global user settings. Saving resources for low performance platforms and increasing accessibility for motion vunerable persons.

- Increase responsiveness, tailor a better user experience on tablet and mobile.
I definitely intend to rewrite this app in a mobile friendlier language such as Flutter.

I would like to streamline the weight of the app, increase performance on lower memory systems.
